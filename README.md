# vuePractice
In this app, I followed the step by step course from https://www.zmrenwu.com/courses/vue2x-todo-tutorial/ to finish all the functions.
I didn't fully copy how the author implemented the app. Most of the time I thought about the idea and finished them by myself.
This practice still helped me a lot because it teached me how the Vue works and how the author thinks.
